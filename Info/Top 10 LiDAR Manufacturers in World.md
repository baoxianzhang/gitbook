# Top 10 LiDAR Manufacturers in World

https://www.marketresearchreports.com/blog/2019/04/22/top-10-lidar-manufacturers-world



The LiDAR market in 2018 was valued between USD 1.30 to USD 1.35 billion which could reach USD 5.5 billion by 2024. 

 

Consumption of LiDARs are mainly dominated by Automotive sectors, especially the recent pool of investment flowed-in self-driving/autonomous cars has increased the demand three-fold and it is expected that Automotive LiDAR alone generates USD 2.5 billion in revenue by 2025.

 

**The top 10 LiDAR Manufacturers in World are:**

1. **Hexagon AB**
2. **Velodyne Lidar Inc.** 
3. **Sick AG**
4. **Topcon Positioning Systems, Inc.** 
5. **Trimble Inc. (Geospatial)**
6. **RIEGL Laser Measurement Systems GmbH** 
7. **Teledyne Optech** 
8. **Leosphere**
9. **Waymo LLC** 
10. **Valeo S.A.** 

Competition is becoming more and more intense with new product launch and a lot of new announcements and takeovers are happening around the world. For instance, Lumotive, the Bill Gates-funded startup developing a LiDAR system for autonomous vehicles, has introduced a disruptive beam-steering technology that aims to significantly improve the performance, reliability, and cost of lidar systems for the emerging self-driving car industry. Initially targeting the robotaxi market.


Alphabet Inc. funded Waymo also started manufacturing its own LiDAR sensors in 2017, which could bring the unit price down from USD 75,000 for an off-the-shelf LiDAR sensor to just USD 7,500, which could create unprecedented disruption in the market.
