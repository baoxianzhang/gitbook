# Bundle adjustment

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_adjustment

Given a set of images depicting a number of 3D points from [different viewpoints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy), **bundle adjustment** can be defined as the problem of simultaneously refining the 3D [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system) describing the scene geometry, the parameters of the relative motion, and the optical characteristics of the camera(s) employed to acquire the images, according to an optimality criterion involving the [corresponding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_problem) image projections of all points.

Its name refers to the bundles of light rays originating from each 3D feature and converging on each [camera's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera_model) optical center, which are adjusted optimally with respect to both the structure and viewing parameters (similarity in meaning to [categorical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_(mathematics)) [bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_(mathematics)) seems a pure coincidence).
