# what you believe

The goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have; the goal is sell to people who believe what you believe.

The goal is not just to hire people who need a job; it's to hired people who believe what you believe.

If you hire people just because thay can do a job, they will work for your money, but if you hire people who believe what you believe, they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears.
